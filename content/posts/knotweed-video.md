I was watchin' a bit of youtube today, and this [lovely video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0MP6_E4z78)
about japanese knotweed came up. It seemed worth a share. 

I like the video a lot, and highly recommend watching it.

I do have a few differences of opinion though. These opinions are based on my personal experience,
which is partially defined by the fact that I only own about .2 acres.

On your own property, in my experience, you can control knotweed within a couple of years by
following this protocol:
1) Every few weeks (between like...1-4 depending on your knotweed), clip the knotweed near the base
    and paint the stump with pure glyphosate. There's actually a lot to unpack there. What is "pure
    glyphosate", is it safe, etc. 
    
    Glyphosate is carcingogenic, so you should wear gloves and definitely try not to touch it. 
    "pure" glyphostate means getting a bottle (usually roundup) that doesn't have other herbicides in
    it. Here's why: glyphostate works by being absorbed by the plant and desicating it. If you buy a
    glyphosate mixture, the other chemicals are usually meant to destroy the plants structure quickly.
    This is so it makes it look like the chemicals are working faster. However, these chemical work
    faster than glyphosate, and they destroy the mechanisms by which glyphosate can penetrate deeply
    into the roots. So if you want to do maximum damage to the knotweed, you need to make sure you buy
    pure glyphosate without the other chemicals. If you're buying roundup, it's the one with the red
    top. 
    
    Painting means pouring a small amount in a disposable container, and then using a brush to paint the
    poison onto the stump of each cut cane of knotweed. It's labor intensive, but it pays off pretty
    quickly.
    
    Glyphosate generally [degrades pretty
    quickly](https://web.archive.org/web/20150828151524/http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/glyphotech.html),
    so this sort of targeted intervention should have a very limited effect on anything else in the
    area. (By targeted, I mean: don't spray.)

2) Dry, heat, or burn the knotweed you cut down on the hottest surface you can find. Asphalt is
good. Asphalt with the knotweed in a black plastic bag is better. Try to avoid leaving it on dirt.
The ability of this plant to regenerate itself is insane. 

3) If you can burn the dried remains, do that, especially if it's not gone to seed yet.

Here are things to definitely *not* do with knotweed:
* *DO NOT* dig it up. A fingernail size remant of it's roots (rhyzomes) will re-establish the
    colony.
* *DO NOT* pull it up. This is even worse than digging.
* *DO NOT* put it in compost or yard waste. This will just spread it horrifically. This probably
    include municipal compost, unless you know *for sure* that they heat their compost enough to
    kill knotweed. I don't know that this is possible, because my internet search has failed to find
    any data on commerical composting vs knotweed.
* *DO NOT* just throw it on the ground. This stuff can regrow from that. 


Anyway...we're always happy to help deal with a knotweed infestation. Let us know if you need help?

Also: remember knotweed is a communal problem. Talk to you friends and neighbors about their
knotweed!
